IT Troubleshooting
Experience: Expert (10 yrs)
Companies: CEL Computers, Biomedical Systems, Roundedcube,Dell Software Group, Quest Software, Ralis Services
From a young age, I worked with my father to troubleshoot PC issues. He registered a DBA under the name CEL Computers, with the E standing for Erin. From troubleshooting why developed software wonâ€™t open as well as troubleshooting complex medical software installations (Biomedical Systems), I moved on to more web-based troubleshooting at Roundedcube such as assisting a client figure out that a bug they reported was caused by a company-wide PC setting that was causing browser media to open in windows media player. At Dell Software Group/Quest Software, I was the first point of contact on the Support Portal Web team when it came to customer reported issues-- I worked closely with a customer relations manager to review potential portal related issues, or in many cases to identify an issue with a specific user account. At Ralis Services I assist in a myriad of troubleshooting surrounding our Customer Relationship Manager (CRM), Lead management system, databases, websites, and web applications.
